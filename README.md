## README: EDA - Exploratory Data Analysis in R

### Overview
This project explores country-level economic indicators and network node degree distributions using R. It covers:

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** of country statistics.
2. **Dimensionality Reduction** using **PCA** and **t-SNE** to visualize similarities between countries.
3. **Clustering** using hierarchical methods.
4. **Network Degree Distribution** analysis from a graph dataset.

### Packages Required

Make sure the following R packages are installed:

```r
install.packages(c("ggplot2", "ggrepel", "Rtsne", "tibble", "pheatmap", "gridExtra"))
```

### What the Analysis Covers

#### Part 1: Country Stats Analysis
- **t-SNE Visualization** of countries in 2D space.
- Identified 5 countries most similar to **New Zealand**.
- Compared with clustering output (cut from hierarchical dendrogram).
- Plots include heatmaps and t-SNE visualizations.
  
#### Part 2: Network Degree Distribution
- Histogram of node degrees.
- Line plot of sorted degrees.
- Visual insights about scale-free or sparse network structure.

---

### Notes
- All data was **scaled** before PCA and t-SNE to ensure fair comparisons.
- Both **average** and **complete** linkage methods were tested for clustering.
- Interpretation and comparisons are included in markdown comments within `.Rmd`.
